# Call me Christopher

Or call me CJ, or maybe call me Coronax. Or don't call me at all, I'm not the boss of you. I'm a computer scientist, a retrocomputing enthusiast, an ex-podcaster, a one-time VR researcher, an intermittent blogger, and a software developer with a very nonzero number of years of experience. In the present day, I'm the VP of Product Development at [iSEEK Corporation].

## What can you find here?
Nothing very serious, actually. This site is primarily for hobby projects, experiments, and toys. Maybe you'll find some of them fun. Expect to find:
- Retrocomputing projects - software for exciting old computers like the Amiga and the Commodore 64. 
- Arduino sketches, breadboard computers, and maybe some baremetal Raspberry Pi programs.
- Realtime graphics, and maybe some offline rendering.

Well, maybe not all right away, but we'll see what makes it into the public eye.

## Where else can you find me?

[CJ's Project Blog] - I have a blog - I know, how unfashionable! It's been dormant for a while but I'm hoping to rejuvenate it in the near future.
